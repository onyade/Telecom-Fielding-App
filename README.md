# Telecom-Fielding-App
Mobile/Desktop Telecom Fielding Application

Developed a user-friendly interface for field technicians to upload fielding pictures and documents to the application using AngularJS, Django and RESTful API architectures for front end/back end communication
Added the ability for field managers to review and approve fielding pictures and documents before they are uploaded to the system using a Node.js-based data access control system, which created webhooks containing an event approval process
Integrated a database management system utilizing PostgreSQL and Django ORM, to store metadata about the pictures and documents, including their approval status, and user roles.
